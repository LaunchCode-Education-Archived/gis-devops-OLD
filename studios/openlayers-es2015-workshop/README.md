title: "Studio - OpenLayers ES2015 Workshop"
---

This activity gives you practice with JavaScript, ES2015, Webpack, and OpenLayers

## Getting Ready

- Fork the [LaunchCodeTraining/openlayers-eslint-workshop-studio](https://gitlab.com/LaunchCodeTraining/openlayers-eslint-workshop-studio) and clone it to your laptop.
- Open the project in your favorite JavaScript editor (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Webstorm, or even Intellij if you have a JavaScript plugin installed)

## Your Tasks

You are going to follow a serious of instructions in an OpenLayers gitbook (link below), with a few differences
- **DON'T DO IT**, when the instructions tell you to download the latest `workshop release`
- Instead you are going to use the repo you forked and cloned in the setup for this studio

Go Through Each Example in the Instructions
- Instructions -> [OpenLayers Workshop Instructions](https://openlayers.org/workshop/en/)
- Take your time and read the examples and documentation
- The example code does NOT pass our project's defined eslint rules
- After copying or retyping the examples, make the code pass the eslint rules
- You can do this all in one branch. Please commit after each main section `Basics`, `Vector Data`, `Vector Tiles`, `Raster Operations`

*If* you have `npm start` running in a terminal. The ESLint rules will run automatically each time you save a `*.js` file. Also your `index.html` will refresh automatically in your browser, no need to manually refresh.

## Turning In Your Work

If you don't complete each of the tasks, turn in as much as you have completed by the end of the day. *You should make sure you have working code committed to your fork.*

- Commit and push your work to GitLab
- Create a MergeRequest and post it to slack for others to review
- If your repo isn't public, be sure to add your instructor and other members of the class to your project
