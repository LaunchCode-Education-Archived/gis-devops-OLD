In this walkthrough, the instructor will guide you through working with the Unix operating system.

## Getting Started

We are going to be using [Docker](http://www.docker.com/) to quickly spin up some fresh Unix images.

[Click Here](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg) to download the Docker .dmg file.  Once downloaded, install Docker on your computer.
